The Challenge: The "Amazon Cart" Logic
Scenario: You are building the backend for an e-commerce checkout. You have a cart (List of Dictionaries). You have a coupon_code (String).
Requirements:
1. Calculate Total: Sum up price * quantity for all items.
2. Apply Coupon:
If code is "VIDYA20", give 20% off.
If code is anything else, give 0% off.
3. Apply Tax: Add 18% GST on the discounted price.
4. Shipping:
If final total < 500, add 50 shipping.
Otherwise, shipping is Free (0).
